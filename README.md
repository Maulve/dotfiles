# Welcome to my dotfiles!

**WARNING: using install.sh is NOT intended to be used with an existing install. It WILL delete a lot of your config files.**

These dotfiles are a heavily modified version of ML4W's dotfiles
https://gitlab.com/stephan-raabe/dotfiles

It aims to make configuration more streamlined and direct. (personally I find this easier to manage)
Furthermore, it removes / changes stuff I don't need / like.
