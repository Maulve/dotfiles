# Welcome to my dotfiles!

![desktop](./img/desktop.png)

**WARNING: DO NOT USE install.sh. It is currently BROKEN and will DELETE your existing configs.**

These dotfiles are a heavily modified version of the [ML4W dotfiles](https://gitlab.com/stephan-raabe/dotfiles).

They aim to make configuration more streamlined and direct (I find this easier to manage).
Furthermore, it removes / changes stuff I don't need / like.

## Main Packages

- Editor: micro, Sublime Text

- Launch Menus: rofi (Wayland fork)
- Colorschemes: pywal
- File Manager: Thunar, ranger
- Browser: Firefox

**Why two text editors?**
I use micro for very small file edits, usually config files.
Sublime Text however is for bigger projects where I also require proper syntax highlighting and autosuggestions.

Although I am waiting for Zed to be ported to Linux, as I really love what I've seen of it so far.

"Why not neovim, it's literally so much better!!"
I have tried it out, and can't really wrap my head around the keybindings and just very different way of doing things.
Maybe I'll give it another shot sometime, but currently I don't see myself using it.


**Why two file managers?**
Ranger is really great, but for example when I need move files around I have a much better time with Thunar.
Though, Ranger is especially neat when navigating fast and just editing text files (mostly configs).
