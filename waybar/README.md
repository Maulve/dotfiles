## Create your own theme based on the starter theme

Please check the configurations of the folders in waybar/themes

A good starting point is to copy the default theme.

Copy the folder waybar/themes/default and name the copy for example to mytheme.

Select your new theme by changing the "theme" variable in waybar/launch.sh

To customize your theme, you can edit the files config, style.css and modules.json 

You can reload the waybar theme with <kbd>SUPER</kbd> + <kbd>SHIFT</kbd> + <kbd>B</kbd>
